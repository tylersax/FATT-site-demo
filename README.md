# A demo site for developing the new FATT website 

Some observations from the first prototype:
1) The atmosphere gradient works! I especially like the little details like subtly twinkling starts, "lens flare" in the light atmospthere, and the transparent cloud.
2) However, I realized when building this that the visual metaphor is not quite right if you take direction literally. That is, as you scroll down you feel like you're moving in the "down direction" towards earth. But the atmosphere goes from earth color to space color, as if you're moving up. One option would be to reverse the gradient so you feel like you're starting "at apogee" (which would be a nice tie in with the tagline!) then you "scroll back down to earth." We would lose the neat cloud effect at the top, but maybe we could incorporate it somewhere lower on the page. I could also imagine that in the footer there is an outline of Fisk or something like that which could be cool.
3) The "projects" section works well. I decided to combine past and future projects into one component, and just visually distinguish the future projects as "planned"
4) History section might be too long, but
5) Overall I think the "single page" approach is good for the kind of site structure we're shooting for
